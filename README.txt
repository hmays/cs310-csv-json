This is a basic CSV to JSON and JSON to CSV data converter. This project was completed while in my software engineering 1 class at
Jacksonville State University. This was the first time I had ever been introduced to these data formats, but I am aware that I will
continue to use these data formats while working in the industry. Once I completed this project, I had a much better understanding
of these data formats and ultimately a better grasp on coding. Professor Jason Snellen provided a skeleton for this project and he 
provided good documentation for the project.
