 <h1>A BRIEF OVERVIEW</h1>
 <p>
This is a basic CSV to JSON and JSON to CSV data converter. This project was completed while in my software engineering 1 class at
Jacksonville State University. This was the first time I had ever been introduced to these data formats, but I am aware that I will
continue to use these data formats while working in the industry. Once I completed this project, I had a much better understanding
of these data formats and ultimately a better grasp on coding. Professor Jason Snellen provided a skeleton for this project and he 
provided good documentation for the project. In this program, I utilized the OPENCSV and the JSONSIMPLE libraries to more easily parse the data and convert it to the opposite format.

<h1>CLASS FILES</h1>
 
 
<h2>Main File</h2>
		
<p>
I began the main file by reading the pre-written file that contains the CSV data and the JSON data. This file contains sample data provided by professor J. Snellen at Jacksonville State University.

<h2>Converter Class File</h2>
	<p>
		The main purpose of the converter file is to read in either CSV or JSON data and call the correct method. The first method accepts CSV data and converts it to JSON. The second method reads JSON data and converts it to CSV data.
Below is the CSV to JSON method:
